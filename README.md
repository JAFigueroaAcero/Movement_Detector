# Movement_Detector
 Movement detector used to a pendulum

This set of python codes were used to analize the movement of different experiments of the movement of a pendulum.

- assets directory has the principal data saved and that had less noise in the simulation.
- assets_graphs directory has the different analysis charts that were made for all assets documents.
- nonfunctional has the data that had noise or use to set the initial data.
- def has an example of the default chart that would be created if data is correctly set.

To be able to set a distance camara to moving object a mark with a black vertical line and next to it a horizontal line with a thigt
- horizontal: length, 2cm; width, 5cm.
- vertical: length, 5cm; width, 2cm.

This code was used to make a spring pendulum, to be able to use it just as a movement detector or normal pendulum see functions2.py and functions.py and its functions definition and documentation to use it to create a new main.py file or modify current main.py or main2.py.

- To create own assets directory use the correct files and functions
- To create own assets_graphs directory use the correct functions_graph.py, functions_graph2.py, maingraph.py or maingraph2.py.

- In every file initial values might be changed to fix colors issues, accelerate frames per second, change kernel of data recapitulated, etc. Every initial value is described in the functions.py corresponded file.
